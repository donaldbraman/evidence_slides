					# Diversity & Respect  
					I want all of you—with all your diverse backgrounds and perspectives—to be well served by this course, and that the diversity that you bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. I endeavor to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally or for other students or student groups.

					# What are we reading?
					I distribute the materials for free.  If you like, you can print them out or have your computer/phone read them to you as you fall asleep.  
					If you want to buy one book that will answer most evidence questions, you should buy the most recent edition of the Mueller & Kirkpatrick hornbook (different from the M&K casebook).

					Quizzes
					These are pass/fail, but you can take them until you pass.  They account or 20% of your grade.

					Panel Assignments
					Starting next week, I will assign you to a panel of attorneys representing the prosecution/plaintiff or the defense.

					Hypothetical
					100 people were in a building who had the opportunity to commit a theft.  Let’s say that there is an eye witness who will identify Bob as being the culprit. Case closed?  
					
					Let’s assume their ID accuracy at 20:1.  What are the odds that it was “Bob”?  
					
					
					---

					Bayes’ Theorem SimplifiedPrior Odds * Likelihood Ratio = Posterior Odds
					1:100 * 20:1  =  20:100 =  1:5
					17% (rounded)
					
					If only two people had an opportunity to commit the theft? 
					1:1 * 20:1  =  20:1
					95% (rounded)
					
					100 people & fingerprints & eye-witness ID?
					1:100 * 20:1 * 46:1  = 920:100
					90% (rounded)

					Smith v. Rapid Transit
					
					---
					
					Smith v. Rapid Transit
					Plaintiff claims she was run off the street by a bus.  The only bus company permitted to run the route at the time of the accident is Rapid Transit. 
					The court finds that “the mathematical chances somewhat favor the proposition that a bus of the defendant caused the accident.” 
					What is the standard of proof in this case?
					
					
					---
					
					Smith v. Rapid Transit
					A “proposition is proved by a preponderance of the evidence if it is made to appear more likely or probable in the sense that actual belief in its truth, derived from the evidence, exists in the mind or minds of the tribunal notwithstanding any doubts that may still linger there.”
					
					Is the plaintiff’s claim supported by a preponderance of the evidence? 
					
					---
					
					Smith v. Rapid Transit
					It was said in Sargent v. Massachusetts Accident Co. that it is “not enough that mathematically the chances somewhat favor a proposition to be proved; for example, the fact that colored automobiles made in the current year outnumber black ones would not warrant a finding that an undescribed automobile of the current year is colored and not black, nor would the fact that only a minority of men die of cancer warrant a finding that a particular man did not die of cancer.” 
					
					---
					
					Hypothetical
					What if the plaintiff claims to have caught a glimpse of the driver through the bus window. 
					Her attorney shows her a picture of the Rapid Transit driver scheduled for that bus route, plaintiff says: “I think that’s probably him.”  
					Plaintiff  then identifies the driver in court. 
					
					---
					
					Hypothetical
					Are there some potential problems with this proof? Do those problems have anything to do with probability or math? Could we turn those problems into math problems? Should we?

					People v. Collins
					
					Estimates
					Characteristic & Individual Probability
					A.	Partly yellow automobile: 1/10	
					B.	Man with mustache: 1/4	
					C.	Girl with ponytail: 1/10 	
					D.	Girl with blond hair: 1/3 	
					E.	Negro man with beard: 1/10	
					F.	Interracial couple in car: 1/1000
					So: 1 / 10*4*10*3*10*1,000  =  1 / 12,000,000
					
					---

					Problems?
					Problem 1: No Foundation
					Foundation means that the evidence being presented is both relevant and authentic. The prosecutor is making up the numbers, and the method hasn’t been reviewed. 
					Problem 2: Mathematical Errors
					Even if accurate numbers, his method is terrible. No prior or independence. 
					Problem 3: Bias
					Which of the items jumps out at you as the best identifier? Maybe the interracial bit?  
					
					---

					The Death Penalty
					In capital cases, there are several compound questions: how much more likely are black defendants to be arrested, prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced to death for killing a white person than are other homicide defendants. 
					By and large, courts have focused on just one facet of the capital case: jury selection under Batson. Here, the data is fairly damning: prosecutors in many jurisdictions successfully challenge and exclude a much higher percentage of black jurors than white jurors. 
					Attorneys have gotten smart about judicial skepticism regarding solely statistical arguments, and now bring in additional evidence of bias, including the labelling of prospective Black jurors who drink as “blk wino[s]” and White jurors as “good old boy[s]”. 
					
					---
					
					Practical Takeaways
					Courts rarely find statistical evidence alone to be dispositive. 
					Courts often admit statistical evidence so long as it is probative and not overly prejudicial. 
					Be on the lookout for failure to introduce a "prior estimate" of likelihood.
					Be on the lookout for failures to introduce evidence of error outside of perfect conditions.
					
					---

					Theoretical Takeaway
					There are many concerns about the utility of statistical evidence, many of which cluster around untested hypotheses regarding juror cognition and bias. But this is true for all evidence! Bad statistics can taint a trial just like any other evidence, so treat it like any other evidence: with healthy skepticism.
