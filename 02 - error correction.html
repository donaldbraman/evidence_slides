						# Bayes' Rule Requirements
						- A prior estimated likelihood of the hypothesis being true.  
						- A likelihood ratio associated with positive test results.  
						
						With them, you can update your priors using new evidence.   
						If you don't have one or the other, something is missing.

						# Recap 
						- **The rule:** courts do not allow for solely probabilistic argument. Probabilistic arguments must be accompanied by physical or testimonial evidence.  
						- **The policy:** bayesian probability calculations are great, but their utility at trial will depend on context and other considerations.

						## Dershowitz on Domestic Violence  
						- Dershowitz claimed that “the likelihood that any man who assaults his wife or girlfriend will murder her is less than 1 in 2,500”, and thus Simpson's prior assaults on his wife had no bearing on his possible guilt. Is that right?   
						- No.  Men who assault their partners are, according to the expert statisticians who reviewed the data, between 5 and 10 times as likely to kill their partners as are men who do not assault their partners.   
						- Even more damning for O.J. Simpson, the percentage of wealthy white women abused by their husbands AND killed by drug dealers is smaller still.

						How do judges and experts think about evidence?  

						- Rational Truth-Seeking  
						- Bias Correction  
						- System Legitimacy  
						- Pragmatism

						## Pragmatism 
						![Thurgood Marshall](assets/marshall.png)
						
						
						---
						
						
						Great advocates have range & intuition about how to connect with their audience, both rationally & emotionally.  
						
						
						---
						
						## Don't Be Intimidated!
						Every piece of evidence can be thought of as a new method of proving (or disproving) some fact.  That piece of evidence can be turned into a statistic.  
						### Don't be intimidated by people who try to bluff you with statistics. They are probably are exaggerating their degree of certainty. Call their bluff!

						## 606(b)(2)(A) extraneous prejudicial information    
						- NOT allowed:
							- “My sister knows this guy and he does this all the time.”
							- “I read a newspaper account, and they had all this evidence we're not seeing.”  
						- Allowed: 
							- “I'm a mechanic and that's not how cars work.”
							- "I've been to that store, and that seems like a dangerous situation."
						- The difference:
							- External knowledge is OK so long as it is not prejudicial.
							- What is prejudicial?   

						---

						(B) Outside influence. Typically bribes or threats. But NOT jurors bribing or threatening each other. 
						Error on the verdict card.  But NOT evidence that jurors were fundamentally mistaken about the evidence, the law, or instructions.

						Tanner v. US
						
						
						---
						
						
						
						
						
						Tanner v. US
						One juror reported that:
						several jurors drank at lunch throughout the trial;
						“the jury was on one big party”;
						the foreperson drank a liter of wine on three different occasions;						
						three jurors regularly smoked marijuana;
						two used cocaine several times; and
						one juror sold another juror a quarter-pound of marijuana during the trial. 
						
						606(b) Jurors Competency as a Witness
						(2) Exceptions. A juror may testify about whether:
						(A) extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's attention;
						(B) an outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror; or
						(C) a mistake was made in entering the verdict on the verdict form.
						
						Tanner's Lessons
						Courts are very reluctant to reverse jury verdicts.  
						
						They are even more reluctant to inquire as to what occurred during deliberations, and to use testimony of jurors about deliberations as grounds for overturning verdicts.  
						
						Tanner's Lessons
						“Internal” Influences such as:
						insanity,
						bizarre beliefs,
						inability to comprehend, and 
						cognitive defects
						are not open to inspection or “impeachment”. 
						
						Tanner's Lesson
						Had the conduct been reported *during* the trial, a mistrial could have been declared. 
						
						Moreover, some misconduct is grounds for post-conviction remedy (typically retrial).  
						
						Tanner's Lessons
						“External” Influences
						Bribes & Threats
						Reading inflammatory reports about the case
						Improper contact with an interested party
						Information about bias indicating a faulty voire dire
						can be sources of impeachment testimony and grounds for reversal.
